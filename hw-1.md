## Problem Description
* [Test authorization form](#test-authorization-form)
* [Find relevant colleague to ask questions](#test-authorization-form)
* [Define steps of working process](#define-steps-of-working-process)

### Test authorization form

Wikipedia defines [authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) as <i>"the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular."</i> In this case this process is relevant to cyber security and system administration. To test that functionality we have to have information about policies, groups, databases, and authorization methods on our service.

### Find relevant colleague to ask questions

Whom we shell to seek to ask questions?<br>
In my opinion, the first person we ask to help is our team leader. First, he has to know, that we have some issues. Second, he may know the answers to our questions without disturbing personal from different departments.<br>
If we can not get help from our team leader, we would find help in cyber security or in the system administration department.

### Define steps of working process

1. Attentively read and reread the task. Try to understand all points of the subject.
2. Research all issues: privileges, databases and framework methods. Some bugs and solutions could be described in the manuals.
    - If you find the issues are over your competencies, you can [ask](#find-relevant-colleague-to-ask-questions) for advice or additional manuals.
3. Prepare standard test: 
    - Empty string
    - String over the max/min length
    - Forbidden chars
    - Check routine scenarios
4. Report to the team leader.
